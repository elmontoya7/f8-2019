I'm just tired
I just want to be done
I just want to be alone
I want to go home
If anything happens to me, promise to take care ofï¿½
I'm just stressed out
I'm having a hard time
No one cares
I don't care
What will heaven be like?
I should just kill myself
I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this
I feel so much better
You know I love you, right?
I want to disappear
I want to tell you something. Oh, never mind
I don't know
I'm not feeling good
I don't think I'll be at school next week
